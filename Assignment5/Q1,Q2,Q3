// scores : 3 / 3
Question 1:

Error1:
public setName(String name)
{
return name;
}

Here return type is not mentioned. It should be changed as public String setName(String name)

Error2:
public Book(int size){
  this.size = size;
  }
public Book(int price){
  this.price = price;
  }
  
There are two constructors with the same parameters. The parameter list should be different.


Question 2:

void getTime(){
  return time;
  }
  
Here return type is mentioned as void but is returning string.
So it shoudl be changed as String getTime()

Question 3:
1)
Output:
0
0
10
0
20
